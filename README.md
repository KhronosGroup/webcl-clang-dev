webcl-clang-dev
===============

The [WebCL Validator](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/webcl-validator)
project requires Clang as one of its dependencies. The validator
requires that some minor modifications are done to Clang sources and
this project represents those changes. We are planning on upstreaming
these changes later on so that the WebCL Validator could depend only
on the standard upstream Clang.
